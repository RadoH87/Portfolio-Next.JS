<p>I started developing this app a few months ago and I learned a lot from it, but I am looking forward to completing a programming course ‚ù§Ô∏èMegaKurs‚ù§Ô∏è that I have been in for almost a year so I have more time to develop and finish my projects, which I started in the past. However, I would like to share the skills that I have acquired so far.</p>
